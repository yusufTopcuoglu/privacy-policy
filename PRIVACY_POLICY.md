Hit The Spot: Privacy policy
Welcome to the Hit the Spot app for Android!

This is an Android app developed by Yusuf Topçuoğlu. 

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. So the app does not collect, save or send any of your data.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,
Yusuf Topçuoğlu.
Ankara, Turkey.
